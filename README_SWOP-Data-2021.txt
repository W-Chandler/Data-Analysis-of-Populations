Background
----------

The statistical tables in The State of World Population 2021 include indicators that track progress toward the goals of the Framework of Actions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the area of access to education. In addition, these tables include a variety of demographic indicators.

Different national authorities and international organizations may employ different methodologies in gathering, extrapolating or analyzing data. To facilitate the international comparability of data, UNFPA relies on the standard methodologies employed by the main sources of data. In some instances, therefore, the data in these tables differ from those generated by national authorities. Data presented in the tables are not comparable to the data in previous The State of the World Population due to regional classifications updates, methodological updates, and revisions of time series data. 

The statistical tables draw on nationally representative household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), United Nations organizations estimates, and inter-agency estimates. They also include the latest population estimates and projections from World Population Prospects: The 2019 revision, and Model-based Estimates and Projections of Family Planning Indicators 2020 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division). The statistical tables in The State of World Population 2021 generally reflect information available as of January 2021.
